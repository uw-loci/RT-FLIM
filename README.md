# RT-FLIM
This is the Real Time FLIM Estimation Algorithm Benchmarking Framework. 

To use the framework open the script in the Benchmarking folder. 
There are three sections that need checking on initial startup:
 - Python Environment used (Under Set Up The Workspace)
 - User Variables
 - Benchmarking Files
 
This framework collects timing data and estimates memory usage for the following FLIM estimation methods:
 - RLD
 - NC-PCA
 - Phasor
 - LaGuerre
 
More methods can be added without needing to change the overarching framework.
